# Text to SQL Converter with Google Gemini Pro API

This project is a simple yet powerful tool designed to convert natural language text into SQL queries using the Google Gemini Pro API. It facilitates the process of interacting with databases by allowing users to express their queries in plain English or natural language, which are then translated into SQL queries for execution.
